        "a1": "Getting pre-approved with Privat Equity gives you a guaranteed rate and amount before your search, putting you in a stronger negotiating position.",
        "q2": "Can I finance a used car from a private seller?",
        "a2": "Yes! We finance used vehicles from both dealerships and private sellers. For private sales, we'll need the vehicle's VIN, current mileage, and condition details.",
        "q3": "What's the maximum age for a used car to be financed?",
        "a3": "We typically finance used vehicles up to 8 years old at the time of purchase. Vehicle age, mileage, and condition all influence loan approval.",
        "q4": "Do I need a down payment?",
        "a4": "No down payment is required, though making one (typically 10-20%) can reduce your monthly payments and potentially qualify you for better rates.",
        "q5": "What insurance do I need for a financed vehicle?",
        "a5": "Comprehensive and collision insurance is required for financed vehicles to protect both you and the lender.",
        "q6": "Can I trade in my current vehicle?",
        "a6": "Absolutely! If you own your current vehicle outright, the trade-in value can serve as a down payment.",
        "q7": "Can I refinance my auto loan later?",
        "a7": "Yes! If interest rates drop or your credit improves significantly, you can refinance your auto loan for better terms.",
        "q8": "What happens if my car is totaled or stolen?",
        "a8": "Your comprehensive insurance should cover the vehicle's value. Any insurance payment first goes to pay off your loan balance.",
        "q9": "Can I pay off my auto loan early?",
        "a9": "Yes! There are no early repayment penalties on our auto loans. Paying off your loan early saves you money on interest.",
        "q10": "What if the car I want costs less than my approved amount?",
        "a10": "Perfect! You'll simply borrow the amount you need for the vehicle purchase plus associated costs. There's no obligation to borrow the full approved amount."

        "a1": "A business loan is intended to finance your professional activity and requires accounting documents from your business. It generally offers higher amounts and conditions adapted to business economic cycles. A personal loan finances your personal needs and relies solely on your individual income.",
        "q2": "Can I get a business loan as a sole trader/freelancer?",
        "a2": "Yes, sole traders and freelancers can absolutely apply for a business loan. You'll need to provide your turnover declarations, bank statements, and demonstrate at least 6 to 12 months of activity. Amounts granted depend on your activity level.",
        "q3": "How long does it take to get a response?",
        "a3": "At Privat Equity, you receive a preliminary response within 24 to 48 hours. Fund release generally occurs within 5 to 10 business days after complete file validation and document signing.",
        "q4": "Do I need collateral for my business loan?",
        "a4": "For small amounts (up to €25,000), no collateral is generally required. For higher amounts, a personal guarantee from the director or a lien on business assets may be requested depending on the risk profile.",
        "q5": "Can I repay my business loan early?",
        "a5": "Yes, all our business loans allow early repayment. Depending on the amount and remaining term, early repayment penalties may apply (generally limited to 6 months of interest). These conditions are clearly indicated in your contract.",
        "q6": "How are rates determined for businesses?",
        "a6": "Rates depend on several criteria: business age, financial health (ratios, cash flow), loan amount and term, industry sector, and proposed guarantees. Businesses with a solid balance sheet and stable activity get the best rates.",
        "q7": "Can I apply if my business is being created?",
        "a7": "Yes, we support business creators. You'll need to present a solid business plan, credible financial projections, and ideally a personal contribution. Amounts and conditions will be adapted to your project's development stage.",
        "q8": "What expenses can I finance with a business loan?",
        "a8": "A business loan can finance almost all your business needs: equipment and machinery, utility vehicles, stock and raw materials, marketing campaigns, recruitment, IT development, renovation work, working capital, etc."
